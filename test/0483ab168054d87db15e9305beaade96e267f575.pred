Retirement beckons for McCoy, champion jockey every year since he first won the title in 1997, and he will stop riding immediately if his mount Shutthefrontdoor wins the £1million Crabbie’s Grand National on Saturday. Shutthefrontdoor, trained by Jonjo O’Neill, will be the subject of an avalanche of emotional support and many once-a-year punters will pin their hopes on McCoy delivering a result like he did in 2010 when he won this famous race on Don’t Push It.
