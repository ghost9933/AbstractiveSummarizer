former heavyweight boxing champion Riddick Bowe is offering to post tweets for $20 to anyone who pays him through PayPal. Bowe, who was once thought to have a fortune of $15million, filed for bankruptcy in 2005 after being imprisoned for 18 months for domestic violence and holding his now ex-wife and children against their will.
