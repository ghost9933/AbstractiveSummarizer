Tottenham will take on the very best players from Major League Soccer when they compete in the 2015 AT&T MLS All Stars game as part of the pre-season preparations in the summer. The fixture, which will be broadcast on Sky Sports, will be the only pre-season fixture that Tottenham will play outside of Europe and head coach Mauricio Pochettino is looking forward to returning to the US after the club's tour last summer.
