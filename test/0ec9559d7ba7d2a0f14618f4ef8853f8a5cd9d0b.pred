Sheffield Wednesday chief executive Paul Aldridge will leave the Championship club at the end of next season. 'I am also hoping to be very busy playing my part in the overhaul of the playing squad, the chairman has made it quite clear he wants to be challenging from the start of the new season.' Stuart Gray is the manager of the club and has done well since taking over from former boss Dave Jones.
