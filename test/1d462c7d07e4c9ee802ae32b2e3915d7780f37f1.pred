Pakistan all-rounder Mohammad Hafeez is free to resume bowling in international cricket after remedial work and a re-test on his action. Off-spinner Hafeez, 34, was banned from bowling after being reported for a suspect action five months ago in the first Test against New Zealand in Abu Dhabi and then failing an initial test on its legality.
