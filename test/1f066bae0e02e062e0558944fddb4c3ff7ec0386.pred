Irina Shayk's latest job involves posing in a swimsuit and shades while being filmed writhing around a pool with a hunky male model. Linda Farrow eyewear's Spring Summer 15 campaign shows Irina get close to Jarrod Scott. The behind-the-scenes film shows stunning Irina slowly emerging from the glistening water wearing a pair of Linda Farrow specs, and not much else.
