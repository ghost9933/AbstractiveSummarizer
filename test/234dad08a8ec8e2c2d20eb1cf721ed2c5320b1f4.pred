Horticulturalists have urged people to halt the 'grey sprawl' in Britain which is seeing grass and flowers in front gardens replaced by concrete. More than 7million gardens in Britain have now been paved over and the RHS is calling for people to plant hedges, trees and flowers to turn the UK green again - as grassy well kept gardens boost mood. The Royal Horticultural Society (RHS) is calling on people to plant trees, shrubs, climbers, hedges or flowers to attract wildlife, improve air quality and reduce urban temperatures and the risk of flooding.
