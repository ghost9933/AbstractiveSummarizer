Bayer Leverkusen has released Emir Spahic from his contract with immediate effect following his fight with security personnel after the German Cup defeat to Bayern Munich. Leverkusen managing director Michael Schade says 'the latest revelations from the case last Wednesday leave us no other choice.' Spahic was filmed fighting the club's security personnel, reportedly after they refused to allow his friends entry inside the locker room area.
