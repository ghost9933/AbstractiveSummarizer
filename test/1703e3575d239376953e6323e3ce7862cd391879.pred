David Cameron has been caught joking about Alex Salmond pinching people's wallets in remarks broadcast after a TV interview ended. Mr Schofield said: 'up next, a man who can pinch your wallet, your watch and even your tie without you noticing.' Mr Cameron, who was off camera, could then be heard saying: 'is that Alex Salmond?' Co-host Amanda Holden burst out laughing at the remark as the programme went to ads.
