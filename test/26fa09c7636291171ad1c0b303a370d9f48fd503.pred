detectives investigating the cold-case murder of a mother-of-three who was battered to death in her own home in 1995 believe new DNA evidence could help solve the mystery. Janet Brown was found naked, gagged with packing tape with her arms cuffed behind her back at the foot of the stairs of her family home in Radnage, near Chinnor in Buckinghamshire.
