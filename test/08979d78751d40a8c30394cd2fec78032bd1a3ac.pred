two brothers who died after one of the boys shot the other then turned the gun on himself have been laid to rest in a joint funeral. Kevin Pimentel, 12, shot dead his six-year-old brother, Brady, as they made dinner inside their mobile home in Hudson, Florida last week - before shooting his older brother in the leg and then taking his own life.
