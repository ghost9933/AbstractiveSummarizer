(CNN) -- Most climbers who try don't succeed in summiting the 29,035-foot-high Mount Everest, the world's tallest peak. That's why an experienced climbing group from the Indian army plans to trek up the 8,850-meter mountain to pick up at least 4,000 kilograms (more than 8,000 pounds) of waste from the high-altitude camps, according to India Today.
