Chelsea are discussing the possibility of a post-season tour, a move that could upset numerous international managers. Jose Mourinho didn't rule out a potential 12,000-mile round trip to Japan, home of new sponsors Yokohama Rubber,. No final decision has been made on a destination but if a tour goes ahead, the squad is likely to fly out on either May 28 or 29 for a two-match, week-long trip.
