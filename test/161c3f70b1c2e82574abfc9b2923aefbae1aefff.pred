a survey by social networking and dating site Skout revealed that grilled cheese lovers have more sex than those who steer clear of the snack. the survey also discovered that 81 per cent of its participants who love grilled cheese - the US version of the snack, in which a cheese sandwich made with bread buttered on the outside, is fried until hot and crisp on the outside and gooey in the middle - say they have donated time, money or food to those in need.
