Lyon moved back to the top of Ligue 1 for 24 hours at least after claiming a comfortable 3-1 victory at Guingamp. Nabil Fekir's goal and Alexandre Lacazette's penalty in the first half put Les Gones in control and Guingamp's hopes of a comeback took a blow when Christophe Kerbrat was given his marching orders before half-time.
