Mauricio Pochettino insists Aston Villa manager Tim Sherwood will be shown respect on his return to White Hart Lane - 11 months after he was shown the door by Tottenham chairman Daniel Levy. 'I hope it's a very good reception from the supporters as he deserves that.' On Thursday, Sherwood revealed he is still in touch with Tottenham chairman Levy and went as far as to thank the club for ending his five-month spell in charge last summer, as it meant he had the chance to take over at Villa Park.
