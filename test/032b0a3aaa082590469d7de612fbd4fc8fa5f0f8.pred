Wolves boss Kenny Jackett has told his side they must maintain their focus and follow up victory over Nottingham Forest with another over Leeds United on Monday. Jackett believes it is now just the top eight in the Sky Bet Championship who are fighting it out for the play-off places, with their 2-1 success at the City Ground all but ending the Reds' chances of making a late push.
