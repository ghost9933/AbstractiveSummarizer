Australia celebrate winning the 2013 Rugby League World Cup held in Great Britain. 'It would also be the UAE's 50th birthday, so it all aligns - it will just come down to us getting partners who can help us get that bid together.' The World Cup has only ever been hosted by the major countries - Australia, New Zealand, France and Great Britain - although South Africa submitted an application for the 2017 event which was awarded jointly to Australia and New Zealand.
