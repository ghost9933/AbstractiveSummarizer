Mercedes motorsport boss Toto Wolff believes Nico Rosberg was back to his best in Sunday's Bahrain Grand Prix. 'We are four races into the season and there are another 15 left, so I have no doubt after his driving in Bahrain, which was exceptional, we will have a very strong Nico bouncing back in Barcelona (for the Spanish Grand Prix).' Rosberg is already 27 points adrift of Mercedes team-mate Hamilton in the battle for this season's title.
