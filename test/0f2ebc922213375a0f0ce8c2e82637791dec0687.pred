two thieves murdered a pensioner and dumped his body in an abandoned mine then made it look like a cycling accident, a court heard today. Kevin Cooper and Trewen Kevern allegedly beat David Alderson and left him to drown, before using his keys to steal £40,000 from a safe where he also kept a haul of guns.
