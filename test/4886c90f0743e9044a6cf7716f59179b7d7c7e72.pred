Ukrainian heavyweight boxing champion Wladimir Klitschko says his country is "suffering in the war with Russia" and is "not sure how far it's going to go and how worse it's going to get." "My country is suffering in the war with Russia -- not that Ukraine tried to give any aggression to any other nation, in this particular case Russia, unfortunately it's the other way around," he said.
