Jamie Carragher believes Chelsea captain John Terry is the best defender to have ever graced the Premier League. 'There have been a lot of great centre-backs in Premier League history, but I think he has been the best that we’ve seen.' Blues boss Mourinho was also quick to praise his captain after Sunday's draw and even claimed it was Terry's best performance in a Chelsea shirt.
