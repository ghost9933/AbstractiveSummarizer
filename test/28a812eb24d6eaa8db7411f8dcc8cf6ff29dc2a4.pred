illustrator Lucy Scott, from Edinburgh, had her first baby in 2012, and found that nothing could have prepared her for the roller coaster ride that ensued. She proceeded to capture every experience in a new book, doodle diary of a new mom: an illustrated journey through one mommy's first year, which chronicles this emotional, often fraught time in a new parent's life in a series of wry, honest illustrations.
