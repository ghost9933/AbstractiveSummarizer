(CNN)Governments around the world are using the threat of terrorism -- real or perceived -- to advance executions,Amnesty International alleges in its annual report on the death penalty. "It is shameful that so many states around the world are essentially playing with people's lives -- putting people to death for 'terrorism' or to quell internal instability on the ill-conceived premise of deterrence." The report, "Death Sentences and Executions 2014," cites the example of Pakistan lifting a six-year moratorium on the execution of civilians following the horrific attack on a school in Peshawar in December.
