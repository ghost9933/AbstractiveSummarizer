Jerry Brown ordered state officials to impose mandatory water restrictions for the first time in history on Wednesday, as the state continues to grapple with a serious drought. Brown said Wednesday that he had signed an executive order requiring the State Water Resources Control Board to implement measures in cities and towns to cut water usage by 25 percent compared with 2013 levels.
