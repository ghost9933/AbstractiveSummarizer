police are trying to find a gang of vigilante paedophile hunters accused of posing as children online and then beating up men who agree to meet them. One teenager has told Greater Manchester Police he was beaten up by the gang, who reportedly tricked him into believing he was meeting an underage girl in a church car park after dark.
