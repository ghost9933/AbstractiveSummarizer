the dogs' dramatic decline in fortune is being partly blamed on the Chinese government's wide-reaching anti-corruption crackdown. Luo Yi, general manager of China's largest Tibetan Mastiff puppy farm, told People's Daily Online: 'The anti-corruption drive means people not daring to hand them out as gifts - nor would anyone take one as a gift.' It is also thought recent bans on owning dogs of more than 50kg in several Chinese cities - including Beijing, Zhengzhou, Shanghai and Tianjin - has had a huge impact on the breed's popularity.
