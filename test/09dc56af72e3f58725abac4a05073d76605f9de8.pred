a transgender comedian is the latest real life model to star in a campaign for clothing label ModCloth, in which she models a variety of her favorite feminine styles. Rye Silverman, 32, a Los Angeles-based writer and self-confessed 'gender rebel', has been a fan of ModCloth's designs for years, and often posts pictures of herself wearing the clothing on the company's Style Gallery, an open fashion forum where customers can showcase how they have styled each item to suit their own personal tastes.
