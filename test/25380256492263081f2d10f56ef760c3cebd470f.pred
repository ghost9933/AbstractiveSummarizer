'I've seen some of the names that are coming to England to be involved in the NatWest T20 Blast this summer, so am looking forward to testing myself against some of the best players in the world.' Surrey director of cricket Alec Stewart added: 'Moises is a fine all-round cricketer and will add great depth to our squad.'
