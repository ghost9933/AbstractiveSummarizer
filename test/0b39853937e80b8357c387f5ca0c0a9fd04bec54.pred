Fighter pilots flying the deadly F-35 Lightning II jet have very special secret weapon - a $400,000 helmet that allows them to see through the plane. Six infrared cameras mounted around the aircraft allow its pilots to 'look through' the air-frame, giving them a perfect 360 degree view of their surroundings and enemies.
