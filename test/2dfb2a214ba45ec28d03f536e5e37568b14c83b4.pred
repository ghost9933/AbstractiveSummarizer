Hibs manager Alan Stubbs hailed the bravery of his players after they ruined Hearts’ Easter Road title party with a 2-0 derby win. He saw his men hold on to second place in the Championship with a second straight win, building momentum after a run of three consecutive defeats – and setting them up for Saturday’s Scottish Cup semi-final against Falkirk. Stubbs, who had seen his team play well but fail to beat Hearts in three previous outings this season, said his players had answered those who asked if they had the bottle to win at the business end of the season.
