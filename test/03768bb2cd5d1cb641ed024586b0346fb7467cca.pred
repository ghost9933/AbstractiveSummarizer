two French tourists charged with setting fire to a quokka have been released from jail after spending a week behind bars. Thibaud Jean Leon Vallet, 24, and his cousin Jean Mickael Batrikian, 18, pleaded guilty to animal cruelty after footage emerged of the pair lighting the quokka on fire with an aerosol can and a lighter on Rottnest Island on April 3.
