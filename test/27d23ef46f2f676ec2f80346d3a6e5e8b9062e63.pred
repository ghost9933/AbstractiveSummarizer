Chelsea midfielder Oscar hopes that winning the Premier League title this season can kick-start a period of dominance in English football for the Blues. 'If we manage to lift this trophy and keep this level of performance we certainly will do some other good seasons like this one.' Chelsea travel to the Emirates on Sunday to face their nearest rivals Arsenal, and a win can take them 13 points clear at the top of the Premier League.
