built a prototype house in his hometown of Kecskemet, south of Budapest, with his high school friend Milan Berenyi, after years of research and development. The house was built with a grant from the EU, and showcases the "liquid engineering" concepts Gutai has written about extensively. "It saves energy, when you compare it to a similar building with large glass surfaces -- it's a very clean and sustainable solution." While studying sustainable architecture at the University of Tokyo, in 2003, Gutai got the idea for his water house from a visit to the open air hot baths.
