Yorkshire have signed India international Cheteshwar Pujara until the end of May after cancelling the contract of Younis Khan. Pujara will instead link up with the Division One champions - subject to receiving a work permit - having spent time at the back end of last season with Derbyshire, scoring 219 championship runs for them.
