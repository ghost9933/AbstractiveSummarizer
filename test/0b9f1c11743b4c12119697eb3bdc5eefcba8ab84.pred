Barcelona president Josep Maria Bartomeu has told Lionel Messi that he would like the Argentine star to stay with the club until he retires. 'He has a place here until he decides to quit football.' Messi, who scored his 400th goal for Barca in Saturday's 2-0 triumph over Valencia, is set to play alongside Luis Suarez and Neymar on Tuesday night as Luis Enrique's side face their Champions League quarter-final second leg against Paris Saint-Germain.
