Andy King thinks his 50th goal for Leicester City could prove to be his most important yet. ‘I’ve scored some pretty crucial goals before, but we might look back at the end of the season and that might turn out to be the most important one yet,’ said King,. That proves to everyone - not just ourselves - that we mean business.’ Leicester manager Nigel Pearson praised King, who he brought off the bench with 12 minutes to play and said his team were finally getting the results they deserved after several games this season where they have drawn or lost despite dominating.
