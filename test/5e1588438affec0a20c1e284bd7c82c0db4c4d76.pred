(CNN)Chile's Calbuco volcano erupted twice in 24 hours, the country's National Geology and Mining Service said early Thursday. The agency said it was evaluating the spectacular nighttime eruption, but indicated it was "stronger than the first one." About 2312 inches (60 centimeters) of ash fell in some places, according to the Ministry of Interior and Public Safety.
