released the first trailer for a documentary on the life and music of late British singer Amy Winehouse, who died of alcohol poisoning at the age of 27 in 2011. "Amy" seeks to "truly capture not just the great artist that she was, but also the funny and loving person that most people didn't get a chance to know," the filmmakers said on Facebook after announcing the film in 2013.
