Wolfsburg are looking to bring in another striker and have also considered Edin Dzeko at Manchester City. United, meanwhile, are understood to have made a revised contract offer to Andreas Pereira after the 19-year-old rejected their opening offer. Pereira is out of contract in the summer and unsure of his role under Louis van Gaal as the Dutch coach continues to look for new players to add to his squad.
