Falkirk booked their place in the Scottish Cup final with a smash-and-grab 1-0 win over Hibernian at Hampden Park. The dominant Easter Road side hit the post just before the break through Fraser Fyvie and again in the second half through fellow midfielder Scott Allan, with the Bairns rarely threatening.
