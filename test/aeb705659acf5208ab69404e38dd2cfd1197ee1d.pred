new neighborhood on the grounds of the famous beer-maker in the heart of the Danish capital has attracted interest from all over the world. "Scandinavia has over the past years been attractive to foreign investors," said Claus Lonborg, CEO of Copenhagen Capacity, a non-profit with the aim of growing business in the Danish capital. "given the number of infrastructure and construction developments taking place in the greater Copenhagen area now, we really see an increasing demand and interest." While the first apartments in Carlsberg City went up for sale in March, the area has been alive for years.
