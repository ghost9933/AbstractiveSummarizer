Goalkeeper Rob Green was nutmegged by a ball boy as he tried to retrieve the ball behind his goal during the 3-3 draw with Aston Villa. The ball boy, who initially shames himself by slipping over while retrieving the ball, toys with Green by pretending to hand him the ball back before rolling it between the clearly frustrated 35-year-old's legs.
