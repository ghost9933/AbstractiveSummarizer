: less than a week since it smashed its previous speeds, the so-called Japanese bullet train has entered the record books once more. The seven-car Maglev - short for'magnetic levitation' - hit a top speed of 375mph (603 km/h) and travelled for almost 11 seconds at speeds above 373mph (600km/h) during a test run near Mount Fuji.
