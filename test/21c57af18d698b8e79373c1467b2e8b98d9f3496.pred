the elderly husband who has been charged with the murder of two women in Victoria nearly 24 years ago - one of them being his wife - has described the accusations as 'bizarre'. Robert Penny told the Herald Sun that he was shocked when police charged him with murdering Claire Acocks and his wife Margaret Penny at Old London Coiffure Hairdressers in Portland on May 3, 1991, about 350km west of Melbourne.
